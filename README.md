**Music Genre Clustering & Popularity Analysis**

This project analyzes Spotify music data using Python and machine learning.
It explores audio features to understand what influences song popularity and applies
unsupervised learning to identify natural clusters of music tracks.

**Contents**

-Music_Genre_Analysis.ipynb → Jupyter notebook containing data analysis and K-Means clustering

-Music_Genres.py → Python data analysis and K-Means clustering

-README.md → Project overview and key insights

**Key Insights**

-Energy, loudness, and danceability show the strongest correlation with popularity.

-Songs cluster more by audio characteristics than by genre labels.

-High-energy and high-danceability clusters tend to have higher average popularity.

-Acoustic and instrumental-heavy tracks form distinct, lower-popularity clusters.

-The optimal number of clusters was selected using the silhouette score.

**Tools Used**

-Python

-Pandas and NumPy (data manipulation)

-Matplotlib and Seaborn (data visualization)

-Scikit-learn (K-Means clustering and evaluation)

-Jupyter Notebook
